He had long wanted to ask Evelyn, a local schoolteacher, to court him. Which was alright, since Evelyn had long dreamed of the day when he would summon up the courage to ask her. However, Adam was much too shy to make the first move. Anxious to see these two fine folks get it together, Simon, a local farmer, tried his hand as a matchmaker. For a while it seemed that these two people would be brought together through his homespun wisdom. However, at the very moment of triumph, a tribe of vigilant citizens revealed a sordid secret that sent everything crashing down. Literally. Would this Christmas be a happy one...for anyone in Gladstone?" .

The tale begins with a chilling peek into the near future, when Sebastian and Jarek, now in their eighties, confront a particularly vile religious autocrat, whose reign of terror has led to the destruction of their laboratories, but not their secret weapon. We then take a thousand year leap to a future city-state in which the human aptitude for duplicitous and unjust social schemes has reached its logical culmination in Oasis, a flesh-crawlingly evil dystopia ruled by the most unpleasant gang of conmen and women youre ever likely to encounter. A couple of young scientists who have recently invented a new means of transport, begin to question the morality of the Oasis social order, and decide to do something about it. Meanwhile, back in the forest, Sebastian and Jareks secret weapon are waiting." .
